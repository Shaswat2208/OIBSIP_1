## OnlineReservationSystem.java

This repository contains a Java program `OnlineReservationSystem.java` that simulates an online reservation system for trains. Users can authenticate, make reservations, and cancel reservations.

### Features:

- **Authentication**: Users can log in using predefined credentials.
- **Reservation**: Users can make reservations specifying details like train number, class type, date of journey, and journey details.
- **Cancellation**: Users can cancel reservations using their PNR (Passenger Name Record) number.
- **Dynamic PNR Generation**: Each reservation is assigned a unique PNR automatically.

### Usage:

1. **Compile**: Compile the `OnlineReservationSystem.java` file using a Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac OnlineReservationSystem.java
   ```

2. **Run**: Execute the compiled Java class:
   ```bash
   java OnlineReservationSystem
   ```

### Example Usage:

Upon running the program, users are prompted to log in with their username and password. After successful authentication, users can choose to make a reservation, cancel a reservation, or exit the system.

### Note:

- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed to compile and run the program.
- The program uses standard input/output and requires user interaction via the command line.
